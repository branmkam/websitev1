      <h2>About Me: Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>I am currently a freshman at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill,
         planning to double major in Computer Science, BS, and Linguistics, BA.</p>
      <p>As a musician, I'm a pianist, composer, and producer. It's been mostly for fun so far,
      but I'm planning on releasing an album in a year or two. </p>
      <p>I study foreign languages for fun. I can speak Spanish and Italian fluently (but not natively), and have studied
          Portuguese and French on and off throughout the past few years. I've also learned bits and pieces of some
      other languages from friends who speak them, or by using Duolingo.</p>
         <p>To see my computer science projects, click on the "My Projects" tab!</p>
