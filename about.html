      <h2>About Me: Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>I am currently a freshman at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill,
         planning to double major in Computer Science, BS, and Linguistics, BA.</p>
      <p>As a musician, I'm a pianist, composer, and producer. Since starting college,
      however, I haven't been able to do as much.</p>
      <p>As a linguist, I enjoy studying various languages (mostly Indo-European).
      I can speak Spanish and Italian fluently (but not natively), and have studied Portuguese and French
      on and off throughout the past few years.</p>
