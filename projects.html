    <p>Here is a list of projects I've worked on besides this website!</p>

    <p class = "p50"><b>pronounce.it - </b>  My project at HackNC 2019, created in a team of four. We were runners-up
      in the "Best Beginner Hack" category, as well as Wolfram Award winners! <br> pronounce.it is an Android app that
    utilizes native Google speech-to-text API to help users practice pronunciation of foreign languages. Broken into
  lessons: each lesson has sentences and notifies the user of which specific words they pronounced right or wrong. The wrong ones
  are cycled back to emphasize correct pronunciation. Read more on the Devpost page and the README file on GitHub!</p>

      <p class = "p50"><b>The Kaminski Kasino - </b> An interactive casino built in Python beginning in summer 2019,
        with single-player blackjack and craps! I'm still working on the central interface to navigate
        between games.</p>

    <p class = "p50"><b>TodaLingua - </b> an application built in Java and JavaFX that lets users practice language
      by writing sentences (very elementary, only completed for basic Spanish and Italian).</p>
      <p><a href = "projects.html" target = "_blank">Code Coming Soon!</a>
